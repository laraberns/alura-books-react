# AluraBooks React Project

Welcome to the AluraBooks React project repository! This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for practicing React concepts, including working with components, props, styled components, and managing state using `useState`. Please note that the project is still a work in progress, and there are plans to enhance its features, particularly in terms of responsivity and integration with a Node.js server to collect book data.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a practical environment for learning and reinforcing React concepts. Key objectives include:

- **Component Development**: Practice creating and managing React components.
- **Props Usage**: Understand and implement the use of props to pass data between components.
- **Styled Components**: Explore the use of styled components for enhancing the project's visual aesthetics.
- **State Management**: Implement state management using the `useState` hook.
- **Responsivity**: Improve the project's responsivity for a better user experience.
- **Node.js Integration**: Integrate the project with a Node.js server to collect and manage book data dynamically.

## Project Status

As of the last update, the project is still under development. The core features have been implemented, but there are areas that require further attention and enhancement, such as responsivity and server integration.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Styled Components**: A library for styling React components with tagged template literals.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development (to be integrated).

## To-Do

The following tasks are planned for future development:

- Improve responsivity for various screen sizes.
- Integrate with a Node.js server for dynamic book data.
